## Overview

This was such a nice little project, courtesy of [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)!
I've been knee-deep in learning React that it was nice to go back and code something with pure HTML and CSS. I usually use SASS, but went with plain ol' CSS for this wee project. I went with a mobile-first design (something I do not do enough), and surprisingly... it all just worked out fine in desktop-land as well.
